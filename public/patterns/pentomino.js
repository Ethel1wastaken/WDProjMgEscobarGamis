    title: "R-pentomino",
    description: "The R-pentomino is a small but remarkably active pattern in Conway's Game of Life. Discovered by John Conway himself, it consists of five live cells arranged in a specific configuration that leads to a complex evolution over time. The R-pentomino is known for its longevity and the variety of patterns it generates before eventually stabilizing or dying out. It serves as an excellent example of how simple initial conditions can lead to intricate and unpredictable behaviors in cellular automata. Such a type of pattern is known as a Methuselah.",
